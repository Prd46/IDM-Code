    This was my final animation project for my Design for Media class, the requirements being very simple: 
    just make it mostly black and white and be creative with your designs. I took it as an opportunity to 
    take a deep dive into my emotions again, making something of it to perhaps portray it in a more 
    tangible way. I was in a pretty bad mental state in my first term, feeling the all imposing isolation 
    of Covid restrictions and my fears of inadequacy amongst my peers. By the end though, I was feeling 
    quite a bit better, the quality of this project partially giving me a boost in confidence.
    Drawn in Firealpaca, animated in Krita.</p>
